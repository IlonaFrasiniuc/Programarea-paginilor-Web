    <p class="h2 text-success mt-25 fs-2 ml-32">1. Volunteer and serve</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">Spending your free time helping others or improving your community isn’t just noble. It’s also beneficial for others and yourself. For instance, improving the environment, giving a voice to the less fortunate, and makes you feel like a member of a team. What’s more, volunteering can give you a self-esteem boost, develop new skills, and expand your network.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">There are about five ways that volunteering helps you to do well — while you’re doing good. In other words, volunteering can bolster your portfolio, reputation, and get you a little good publicity. And, it’s one of the best ways to get your mind off of work since you’re focusing on others and not your business.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">Whether if it’s taking a class, learning a new skill on your own, or exploring your neck of the woods, there are plenty of excellent reasons why you should learn something new every day, such as:</p>
            <ul class="list fs-5">
              <li>Enhancing your quality of life.</li>
              <li>Reducing stress and improving your mental health.</li>
              <li>Socializing with others.</li>
              <li>Gaining confidence.</li>
              <li>Discovering, or rediscovering, something that we’re passionate about it.</li>
              <li>Having fun or unwinding.</li>
              <li>Gaining new perspectives and knowledge that you can apply at home or work.</li>

      <p class="h2 text-success mt-25 fs-2 ml-32">3. Take care of your health and wellbeing</p>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">At this point, I don’t think you need to be reminded of the benefits of exercising. You’ve heard it all a million times before. However, physical activity does more than prevent health concerns like obesity and heart disease. It can also alleviate stress, ward off depression, and even increases your productivity — mainly because it improves alertness and energy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">The thing is, you don’t need to hit the gym for a couple of hours each day to reap these benefits. After all, any type of activity that gets you moving is better than nothing. So, maybe every afternoon during a break or after dinner, you go outside for a walk. Do some yoga or have more walking meetings.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">And don’t forget to take care of your mental health as well. Doing things like meditating, talking to a friend on the phone, or treating yourself to a spa day fights back against stress and ensures that you’re addressing your needs.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">I always carry a book with me. In this way — when I have some free time, like waiting for an appointment, I can read. In case you weren’t aware, reading is perhaps one of the most productive ways to spend your time. That’s because reading can:</p>
            <ul class="list fs-5">
              <li>Boost your brainpower.</li>
              <li>Increase your vocabulary.</li>
              <li>Improve your memory, concentration, and imagination.</li>
              <li>Reduces stress.</li>
              <li>It helps you become a better writer.</li>
              <li>Makes your more empathetic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">Would you like to know how you can read about 300 books a year? How many books have you read this year? You don’t get down on yourself if you haven’t been reading. Just start now and see how many you can read before the end of the year.</p>

      <p class="h2 text-success mt-25 fs-2 ml-32">5. Have a hobby</p>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">Every successful person spends their downtime on something that they enjoy that’s outside of work. For example, Bill Gates loves to play bridge, Warren Buffett plays a mean ukulele, and Steve Wozniak plays Segway polo.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">Whatever leisure activity you choose, it’s often associated with many benefits like a stress reliever, encouraging you to take a break and enrich your perspective. They can also promote mindfulness, strengthen relationships, and can even provide an additional revenue stream. Not enough? Depending on the exact hobby, they can also assist you in developing skills like leadership, innovation, communication, and can improve the executive function on the brain.</p>

            <p class="paragraph fs-4">“Take 10 minutes to think about your goals, personal and professional,” suggests Leo Babauta, founder of Zen Habits. “If you don’t have a list of goals, start on one. If you’ve got a list of goals, review them,” he adds.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-4">Additionally, jot down “a list of action steps you can take over the next couple of weeks to make these goals a reality.” And, determine the “action step can you do today,” continues Babauta. “The more you focus on these goals, and review them, the more likely they will come true.”</p>
