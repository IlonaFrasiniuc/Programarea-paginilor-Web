            <p class="paragraph fs-5">Other people will always be on hand to offer up their opinions and advice. Ultimately, however, it’s you who has to live with the consequences of your decisions.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">If you’re feeling overwhelmed with outsider opinions and advice, go off the grid for a few days. Get off social media, put your phone on silent, and tap into your own thoughts and emotions to figure out what your next step should be.</p>

            <p class="paragraph fs-5">Mindfulness is the act of being fully present and aware of where you are, who you're with, and what you're doing – without being distracted by thoughts, judgments, or emotions.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">Or, as the spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle puts it, "Wherever you are, be there totally."</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">We learn how to enjoy the moment, we can become calm, focused, and happy. </p>
              
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">To practice mindfulness, start by removing things that distract you from your environment, like social media, TV, and music. Then, quieten your thoughts by not paying attention to them and instead, focus your attention on your breathing.</p>

            <p class="paragraph fs-5">It's hard to enjoy life every day if you never put your own needs first.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">If you want to feel content and peaceful, you need time to relax, have fun, be productive, explore new things, and develop healthy relationships.</p>            
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">So, the next time someone asks you to do something you don't want to do, consider saying no. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't be kind or help others. It just means that you need to take care of your own needs first.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">Protect your time and energy. You deserve it.</p>

            <p class="paragraph fs-5">We all make mistakes and miss the mark sometimes. Be kind to yourself in these moments. Whatever has happened has happened. There's nothing you can do about the past except to learn from it. This could be incredibly tough in the beginning, but it gets easier with practice.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">Look deeply, and you will discover that you deserve to be happy regardless of who you are, what you've done, or where you're going. You deserve to be happy just because you're alive.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">Give yourself permission to be happy and at peace in this moment.</p>

            <p class="paragraph fs-5">It's pretty challenging to learn how to enjoy life to the fullest if you're tired, burnt out, or stressed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">We all need time to rest and recuperate.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">"It's very important that we re-learn the art of resting and relaxing," writes Thích Nhất Hạnh. "Not only does it help prevent the onset of many illnesses that develop through chronic tension and worrying; it allows us to clear our minds, focus, and find creative solutions to problems."</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">So, make time to learn how to relax and enjoy life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph fs-5">For instance, you could take a quick nap, read a good book, go for a short walk, or even take a weekend trip somewhere quiet.</p>
